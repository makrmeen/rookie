<!--TENIIS-->

<!--1.Health benefits-->
Tennis is a unique sport; it provides both aerobic (endurance) and anaerobic (fast explosive movements) training. The average point in tennis includes bursts of activity and acts to condition our bodies the same way interval training would do. This has a profoundly positive effect on our heart and lungs with studies showing that playing just 3 hours a week reduces the risk of heart disease by over 50%. Furthermore, playing tennis can reduce the rate of decline of our fitness as we get older. In a study looking at 8 different sports it was identified that tennis players had the longest life expectancy, by about 10 years! Tennis is a sport for all ages, genders, sizes and expertise levels, with benefits including maintaining healthy body composition, bone health, muscle strength and balance.

<!--2.Equipment-->
For a tennis player, there is no piece of equipment more important than your racquet. You want a racquet that fits you—and your game. So how do you find the right one?

Racquets today can be broadly (and somewhat crudely) divided into two categories: Frames made primarily out of aluminum, and frames made primarily out of graphite.

Aluminum frames are usually sold pre-strung (i.e., with strings). They’re a great choice if you’re unsure you want to commit to playing long term or if you just want to whack a few balls around with friends. What’s more, they’re affordable: only about $30 in sporting goods stores.

But if you are looking to commit to the game – and plan to join a team and/or take lessons – go ahead and buy a racquet made out of graphite. A graphite frame’s light weight and rigid construction make it much more powerful and accurate. And if you take care of it, it should last you for multiple years.

The prices of graphite frames range greatly, from about $60 to upward of $300. If you’re on a budget, a great way to get value for your money is to go online or to your local pro shop and look for sales on older, discontinued models. Sometimes you can find an extremely nice racquet that’s only a few years old for less than $100.

<!--3.Rules-->
The game of tennis played on a rectangular court with a net running across the centre. The aim is to hit the ball over the net landing the ball within the margins of the court and in a way that results in your opponent being unable to return the ball. You win a point every time your opponent is unable to return the ball within the court.

A tennis match can be played by either one player on each side – a singles match – or two players on each side – a doubles match. The rectangular shaped court has a base line (at the back), service areas (two spaces just over the net in which a successful serve must land in) and two tram lines down either side. A singles match will mean you use the inner side tram line and a doubles match will mean you use the outer tram line.

You need to score four points to win a game of tennis. The points are known as 15 (1 point), 30 (two points), 40 (three points) and the fourth would result in the winning point and the end of that game. If the scores went to 40-40 this would be known as deuce. When a game reaches deuce the player must then win by two clear points.

<!--4.How to practice -->
Tennis is a sport that you can enjoy your entire life. So whether you are five years or sixty-five years old, you can pick it up.If you’ve never played tennis before and want to give it a try, here is everything you need to know to get started.

If you have a wall at home that can be a great way to practice hits and volley drills. You can also practice your tennis serve toss and hit even if you are not on a court. Set up targets to hit at that will help with your accuracy.

How many times a week you play tennis depends on your life and level of competition you want to achieve. College and highschool players often play or train several times a week. Community leagues may only play once or twice a week.

As often as you can. The sport is a blast, and you’ll want to play for the rest of your life. But don’t overdo it. Work up slowly and make sure you have a pro check out on your technique from time to time; this will help you prevent injuries. You can learn a lot about nutrition, fueling and off-court exercises to keep you in great tennis shape in TENNIS.com’s fitness section.

<!-- SWIMMING-->
<!--1.Halth benefits-->
Swimming is an excellent way to work your entire body and cardiovascular system. An hour of swimming burns almost as many calories as running, without all the impact on your bones and joints.One of the biggest benefits of swimming is that it truly works your entire body, head to toe. Swimming:

-increases your heart rate without stressing your body
-tones muscles
-builds strength
-builds endurance

Swimming can be a safe exercise option for people with:

-arthritis
-injury
-disability

other issues that make high-impact exercises difficult
Swimming may even help reduce some of your pain or improve your recovery from an injury. One study showed that people with osteoarthritis reported significant reductions in joint pain and stiffness, and experienced less physical limitation after engaging in activities like swimming and cycling.

<!--2.Equipment -->
Swimming looks like a super simple sport when it comes to picking out the right equipment.Pick out a pair of swim goggles and a swimsuit, and off we go!

But even something as simple in functionality like goggles and a swimsuit come in a nearly endless variety of options.

With swimsuits for lap swimming, there are drag suits, two-piece swimsuits, for the fellas—swim briefs, and even open water and triathlon wetsuits for cold water swimming.

Ultimately, you want a swimsuit that gives you a full range of motion, is at least mildly resistant to chlorine (look for suits high in polyester—they last longest), and is snug enough that it doesn’t create a ton of needless drag and resistance in the water.

Swim goggles are another essential for swimming for exercise. They help you see under the water so that you can keep an eye (or two) out for lane lines, other swimmers, and the wall.

<!--3.RULES-->
Four strokes, or styles of swimming, are contested at swimming meets: freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. Swimmers race a variety of distances, ranging from 25 yards or meters to 1600 yards. Each stroke has specific rules as to how swimmers may propel themselves through the water.

Freestyle

Freestyle, often called the “crawl,” is the most flexible in its rules, and it is typically the fastest stroke. The only rules are that the swimmer may not push off the bottom of the pool or pull on the lane line, and must touch the far wall with some part of their body. Otherwise, swimmers may use any type of stroke. Freestyle is swum face-down with alternating arm strokes; side-breathing; and rapid, alternating up-and-down kicks. Freestyle races begin with swimmers doing forward-facing dives from either a starting block or the side of the pool. In multi-lap races, swimmers can do either an open turn or a flip turn. When doing a flip turn, the swimmer does not touch the wall with his/her hand. Instead, the swimmer’s feet touch the wall. At the finish, freestyle swimmers touch with one hand.

Backstroke

Backstroke is often thought of as “upside-down freestyle.” As in freestyle, backstroke is swum with alternating arm strokes and rapid, alternating, up-and-down kicks. Unlike freestyle, the swimmer must be on his/her back, facing the sky. When swimmers turn their shoulders more than 90 degrees, they are disqualified from the race for not remaining on their backs. The only exception to this rule applies to the flip turn in multi-lap backstroke races: Swimmers may turn onto their stomachs for one arm pull, provided their arm movement is continuous. When their feet leave the wall, swimmers must be on their backs. Backstroke races start with swimmers already in the water. Swimmers place their feet against the wall, and hold onto either the gutter or the grip built into the starting block. At the finish of the race, backstroke swimmers must stay on their backs until they touch the wall, ideally with one hand.

Breastroke

Breastroke is often thought of as the “frog stroke,” as the kick is reminiscent of a frog’s kick. A breaststroke swimmers arms and legs must move simultaneously, on the same horizontal plane, and identically to each other. The arms and legs stay mostly underwater, but a swimmer’s head must break the surface every stroke. So-called scissor kicks are not allowed. The arm stroke begins and ends in streamline position. The hands scoop water out to the sides, before sweeping in toward the middle of the body and then shooting forward. Swimmers are not allowed to pull their hands down past their hips, and must keep their elbows in the water when their hands are shooting forward. On the breastroke kick, swimmers must point their toes out to the side as the feet sweep out, around, and back together. For every arm stroke there must be one, and only one, kick.

Breaststroke races begin with a forward-facing dive from either the edge of the pool or the starting block. At the beginning of each lap, swimmers may do one pull-down: one huge pull, in which the hands sweep down to the thighs, and one giant kick to the surface. On the first stroke after the pull-down, a swimmer’s head must break the surface of the water. Today’s swimmers are also allowed to do one dolphin/butterfly kick in the first part of the pull-down, before the first breastroke kick. At the end of each lap of a breaststroke race, swimmers must touch with two hands, simultaneously and on the same horizontal plane. In multi-lap races, swimmers will use open turns, not flip turns.

Butterfly

Butterfly emerged as a new stroke in the 1950s, as swimmers were trying to find ways to swim breastroke faster. The two primary innovations were the double over-the-water arm recovery, and the dolphin kick. Butterfly is swum with an undulating, dolphin-like movement at the surface of the water. The arms pull underwater simultaneously, and recover over the water, also simultaneously. Both hands must come out of the water at the same time on every stroke. During each arm pull, swimmers do two dolphin kicks, one when the hands enter the water, and one when the hands exit the water. A swimmer’s feet must kick up and down together, ideally with the feet kept close together. While the vast majority of swimmers lift the head and shoulders to breathe, some swimmers breathe to the side, as in freestyle.

Butterfly races begin with a forward-facing dive, and swimmers must finish each lap by touching the wall with two hands simultaneously, on the same horizontal plane. At the beginning of each lap, swimmers will do underwater dolphin kicks, but must break the surface of the water with their head at or before 15 meters. In multi-lap races, swimmers will do open turns, as opposed to flip turns.

<!--4.How to practice-->
Since swimming requires a lot of movements and muscles not typically used on land, swimming also requires a lot of training and practice before it feels easy. So with some know-how, practice, and positive attitude, you can get great results from your workouts.

Plan a swimming routine. You don't need to work out everyday, but try commit to at least three days a week. Decide what time works best for you. Some people find it helpful to swim before work, while others benefit more from swimming after work. It just depends on what your schedule is.

Structure your swim sessions to promote fitness. A 2-hour swim session might look like this:

Warmup - 15 mins, typically 200m freestyle then more easy swims, done at strength pace (focusing on applying constant strong pressure on each movement).
Kick or Pull - 15 mins. It's a great way to loosen up muscles and to start to warm up the legs or warm and get into a rhythm.
Hypoxic - 5 mins, usually done before or after the main set, hypoxic describes the holding of breath under duress or exercise. Do sprints while only taking 1 or 2 breaths per length, or butterfly kick underwater to halfway and then butterfly (breathing every 3 strokes) for the rest of the length. Don't do hypoxic training for very long if you expect to be doing a main set afterwards.
Main Set - 35 mins A short amount of lengths done at high intensity on fast times or lower intensity but lots of laps without rest. A good example is 5 x 50m freestyle on 40 seconds with a target of 30.
Warmdown - Very important, warmdown gives swimmers a chance to recover and stretch out their muscles. You should be aiming to have a good DPS (distance per stroke; doing as little strokes per lap, should be doing 12-16 in a 25m pool).

<!--Rock CLIMBING & Bouldering-->

<!--1.Health benefits-->
Climbing is a versatile, physically demanding sport that can be done indoors or outdoors. Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber’s strength, endurance, agility, and balance along with his or her mental control. 

Here are the top 4 health benefits of climbing: 

Combines cardio and strength into a single workout: During a single session of rock climbing, the body executes a number of physical tests, including boosting heart rate, building muscle and developing stamina. The upper body strength required for rock climbing is a given for pulling oneself up, while the legs and core build muscle as the body strives to find balance. 

Strengthens and tones muscles: climbing requires several different muscles groups to be engaged during the workout. Abs, obliques, delts, traps, biceps, lats, quads, calves – in fact, climbing even works your forearm muscles by strengthening a climber’s grip. 

Increases flexibility: Climbing encourages participants to increase their range of motion. Climbing demands flexibility and adaptility as it requires climbers to reach, leap and climb to handholds and footholds usually far from a comfortable distance. 

Mental strength: In bouldering (a type of rock climbing done without ropes or safety harnesses) the routes climbers take are called problems. Navigating routes demands a climber to judge their individual abilities, such as reach, strength required to complete the next step, current energy levels and route planning. 

Reduces stress: Climbing reduces stress by increasing levels of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter in the body that aids in releasing stress. Climbers oftentimes become immersed in the flow of the activity enabling them to become consumed in the activity of reaching, climbing and leaping, creating as sense of ecstasy. Climbing outdoors also has been proven to further lower stress levels as climbers are more exposed to the sun and Vitamin D.

<!--Equipment-->
Bouldering, sport climbing, rock climbing, mountain climbing, via ferrata...only with the correct climbing equipment can you be safe and really enjoy yourself! There is no absolute standard climbing equipment that covers all mountain sports disciplines. Climbing equipment is as diverse as the sport itself. Boulderers can get by with relatively little equipment (climbing shoes, crash pad, chalk bag and the appropriate clothing). Sports climbers also need climbing ropes, belay device, quickdraws, carabiners, a climbing helmet and maybe even a few cams or nuts.
When it comes to the mountains and alpine walls, the choice of climbing equipment is ultimately a science. Here only the best material is good enough. Depending on the type of tour, a whole range of additional equipment including crampons, ice tools, bivouac equipment and a climbing backpack may be needed. And a whole lot of experience of course.

EQUIPMENT FOR BOULDERING
As we touched on above, boulderers are the climbers who get by with the least climbing equipment. That's why many see bouldering as the most original, purest form of climbing. It's not about the equipment, it's not about strong nerves, it's not about the weather in the bouldering gym. It's about mastering a passage with the correct climbing moves. Originally seen as a training discipline for "real" climbing, E162bouldering has established itself as a completely independent discipline and a unique set of bouldering equipment has developed accordingly. You will find everything you need in our climbing shop.
The most important thing for bouldering is the climbing shoes. They should fit perfectly, offer good grip and allow a good feel for the rock. The second most important piece of climbing gear for bouldering is the crash pad, large mats that prevent impact with the ground in case of a fall. They are available in different sizes, thicknesses and designs. The last thing you need is a chalk bag full of chalk and your bouldering equipment is complete.

SPORT CLIMBERS
Sport climbers need a bit more equipment to safely practice their sport. In addition to the climbing shoes and chalk bag, the climbing equipment of a sport climber consists of at least a climbing rope, quickdraws, carabiners, a belay device and a climbing helmet.
Sport climbers tend to use single ropes. They are easy to handle and can be clipped in quickly. This type of rope is usually the best choice for relatively straight routes and secure climbing on the climbing walls. Caution: Before setting of on a tour you must make sure your rope is long enough (check the climbing topo or ask the locals). Too many serious accidents have occurred as a result of ropes that were too short. At the end of the day, the best climbing equipment is only as good as the climber using it! A conscientious climber gets acquainted with each and every piece of their equipment. Experienced climbing partners and trained climbing instructors can provide you with information about the limits and uses of climbing equipment which you won't find in the instructions.
Quickdraws serve as connection between the climbing rope and the bolts. Locking carabiners can be used in various ways, in combination with a belay device, for example. Ultimately it doesn't matter which type of belay device you go for (tube or semi-automatic) as long as you are familiar with your equipment (see above).
Not all sport climbers wear a helmet, but you shouldn't allow this to influence your decision. As with cycling, helmets should be a matter of course for climbers. Helmets protect against impact from a fall and falling rocks. Falling stones can even occur at busy climbing centres and stones aren't choosy, they'll hit you in the head whether you're a novice or pro! Climbing helmets no longer look like mushrooms or salad bowls and helmets for all head sizes and tastes can be found in our climbing shop.

<!--Rules-->
RULES FOR INDOOR CLIMBING 

BOULDERING
Bouldering is climbing low to the ground without the use of ropes. It is an excellent way to improve climbing strength and technique and a good way to warm up before a top rope climb.
A person who is bouldering should be spotted by another person.
The hands of a person bouldering should never reach the panel wall system (13 feet). Beginners should stay below the first set of wall anchors (10 feet).
Bouldering should not be done underneath roped climbers. Top roped climbers have priority.
Try to climb down when on the wall and not jump down to minimize the risk of injury.

BELAYING
Climbers should provide their own belayer when possible.
Only climbers who have passed a belay certification class or who have passed a belay check (for those who were belay certified at CU in the past) may belay climbers at our wall. Those who are belay certified should always display their belay certification tag (pass) on their harness while at the climbing wall (new for 2015-16).
We teach and use the P.L.U.S. Belay System. That stands for P-Pull, L-Lock, U-Under and S-Slide.
The belayer must clip into the provided belay device (gri gri) with the provided locking carabiner which is attached to the floor anchor.
Other belay devices are not permitted unless approved by the Director or one of the current wall supervisors (for experienced climbers/belayers only).
Belayers must use the palm down belay technique and always keep their brake hand on the rope.
Belayers are responsible to provide a smooth and controlled descent when lowering a climber. Lowering a climber quickly (for fun) is unacceptable and not allowed.

CLIMBING
Proper climbing procedures must be followed. Knots, harnesses and tie-ins must be checked by the supervisor on duty before the first climb each session.
The figure-eight follow-through is the only tie-in knot allowed. The tail must be at least 4-5 inches long.
Proper climbing/belaying commands are to be used (On Belay > Belay On, Climbing > Climb On).
Climbers and belayers should check each others harness (doubled backed), knots, belay device and anchor before every climb.
Do NOT use hangers for holds; you could seriously damage your fingers if you fall.
Care should be given when climbers use adjacent routes, both climbing up and coming down.
Climbers need to be careful not to climb too fast for their belayer. If the belayer is not able to keep up and keep the slack in the rope to a minimum, he/she should communicate to the climber to slow down.
Climbers need to stay below and in-line with their belay anchor to avoid a pendulum swing during a fall.
Do not climb directly above or below other climbers on the wall.
Climbers should never climb over, behind or around the side of the wall structure.
Only those securing a Lead Climbing Pass may lead climb on our wall. Lead climbing classes will be offered during the year for those wishing to learn this advanced type of rock climbing.

<!--4.How to start -->
First of all, don’t think that indoor climbing is all about hanging off your fingertips and taking big falls. Indoor climbing is one of the safest forms of climbing you can do and anyone at any age can do it.

The first thing to do is to find a climbing gym nearest to you. A simple Google search will often do the trick.

Your first visit to a climbing gym can be exciting, intimidating and scary. But don’t be overwhelmed, every climber had to start at some point.

If you’re under 18, different rules might apply so call the gym first. Many climbing gyms offer courses and competitions for young climbers, but you might need parental permission or supervision.

fter you’ve demonstrated that you can tie the knot and belay, you’ll be able to climb without supervision.

If you don’t have someone to climb with, there are often “meet a partner” groups and Facebook pages you can join to meet others.

There are many reasons why people climb at gyms, but the end goal for most is to improve technique, endurance and to get stronger.

Be patient and be honest about your ability. Don’t push yourself too hard, many climbers get injured by trying things too difficult for them.

Ask around and start on the easiest routes. Do lap after lap after lap until you’re comfortable on the easiest climb. This might take one visit or many, but start easy and work on progressing to more difficult climbs.

For many, indoor climbing will lead to outdoor climbing.

If that’s the case then seek a group of experienced outdoor climbers or a professional instructor, because many things are different than in a gym.

<!--JOGGING-->
<!--Health benefits-->
Regular running or jogging offers many health benefits. Running can:

-help to build strong bones, as it is a weight bearing exercise
-strengthen muscles
-improve cardiovascular fitness
-burn plenty of kilojoules
-help maintain a healthy weight.

The difference between running and jogging is intensity. Running is faster, uses more kilojoules and demands more effort from the heart, lungs and muscles than jogging. Running requires a higher level of overall fitness than jogging.

Both running and jogging are forms of aerobic exercise. Aerobic means 'with oxygen' – the term 'aerobic exercise' means any physical activity that produces energy by combining oxygen with blood glucose or body fat.

Some general tips for beginners:
See your doctor for a check-up before you start a running program. This is especially important if you are over 40 years, are overweight, have a chronic illness or haven't exercised in a long time.

<!--2.Equipment-->
Fortunately, you don’t need a lot of fancy, expensive equipment to run, but getting the right running shoes for your foot type is crucial for comfort and injury prevention.
The running shoe should bend easily, feel comfortable and have a wedge of shock-absorbing material in the heel.

The fit should not be too snug. Your foot will splay as it impacts with the ground.
When buying the shoes, wear the socks you intend to wear while running.
Have your shoes professionally fitted.

You can also visit a running store to get expert advice on buying the right running shoes. An expert at the store will look at your feet, watch you run, and make recommendations based on your foot type and running style. If you already have running shoes that you like, but you’ve had them for a while, you may still need to get new ones. Running in worn-out running shoes can also lead to injury. You should replace them every 300 to 400 miles.

Beyond running shoes, you don’t need much more than some comfortable exercise clothes to get started. If you’re running outdoors, make sure you follow some basic tips for how to dress for hot weather running and cold weather running, so you stay safe and comfortable.

As your endurance improves and you start running longer, you may want to invest in some technical fabric running clothes and other basic running gear, such as a running belt, good running socks, and a running hat. Some runners also like to have a running watch to track their times and distances.

<!--3.RULES-->
Start with brisk walking. Aim for 30 minutes per session. Allow a minimum of six weeks to build up to regular running. Aim to increase your jogging time each session, and alternate between walking and jogging.

Make sure you warm up and stretch thoroughly before you head out. Cool your body down with light stretches when you return.

Use your breathing as your guide when running. You should be able to carry on a conversation while running, and your breathing shouldn't be heavy. Don't worry about your pace per mile—if you can pass the "talk test" and speak in complete sentences without gasping for air, then you're moving at the right speed.

Make sure you have plenty of fluids and take a water bottle with you on your run. Try to drink plenty of water before, during and after any activity.

Allow at least two complete rest days per week to avoid overtraining, which may cause injury. Consider other low impact activities, such as swimming, at least once each week.
Plan your route. If possible, choose flat, grassy areas rather than hard or loose (such as sandy) surfaces to reduce the risk of injury.

Avoid running near roads. This is especially important if you have a pre-existing condition such as asthma. Vehicle exhaust fumes can increase your risk of various cardiovascular and respiratory complaints or illnesses.

Avoid the 'peak hour' periods to reduce your risk of inhaling air pollution from motor vehicles. If possible, schedule your runs for either the early morning or the evening.
Wear loose cotton clothing. Dress your upper body in layers of clothing so that you can take off layers as required.

Apply SPF 50+ sunscreen to exposed skin areas.
Buy an appropriate pair of shoes.
