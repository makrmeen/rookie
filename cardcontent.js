Increases flexibility: Climbing encourages participants to increase their range of motion. Climbing demands flexibility and adaptility as it requires climbers to reach, leap and climb to handholds and footholds usually far from a comfortable distance. Mental strength: In bouldering (a type of rock climbing done without ropes or safety harnesses) the routes climbers take are called problems.
