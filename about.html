        <p class="teaser-about">Sandra</p>
        <p>
          Sandra loves putting on her running shoes and run some km to clear her
          head. "Problems and thoughts that have been swirling around in my mind
          disappear when I’m deep in the rhythm of my footsteps and my favorite
          tunes on my mp3 player. I often discover the perfect solution during
          my run or when I’m done with my workout."

        <p class="teaser-about">Carmen</p>
        <p>
          Carmen started climbing one year ago. She likes climbing." It reduces
          syour stress. You'll become so focused on the wall, and the will to
          conquer your particular route, will distract you from your day-to-day
          stresses. What's more, it will also teach you how to solve a problem,
          which is in itself a great strategy to have!"

      <div class="profile">

        <p class="teaser-about">Isabel</p>
        <p>
          Isabel started swimming on a regular base after her stuy. "The first
          reason that I love swimming is that it can be extremely relaxing. On
          the other hand, it can also be a fast-paced competitive sport which
          raises your heartbeat without stressing your body too much.""

        <img class="Teammate" src="assets/Teammate Francesco.jpeg" />
        <p class="teaser-about">Francesco</p>
        <p>
          Francesco is a professional tennis player. He started playing with 7
          years. "It is a technical sport that has beauty and elegance when
          played with fluidity and grace. If you're having a bad day, there is
          nothing better than picking up a racquet and whacking a ball, letting
          the frustration leave your body in one fell swoop. Tennis is
          mindfulness in motion. I play three to four times a week."
